            "Fern (full title: Fern the Human, formerly known as Grass Finn) was the result of Finn's Grass Sword and
            Finn Sword merging into one being. He makes his first appearance at the end of "Reboot.""

            <strong>Fern's Background</strong>
            "In "Two Swords," it is revealed that Fern was created when Finn accidentally broke the Finn Sword with the
            Grass Sword while fighting Bandit Princess, during "I Am a Sword." Some time later a spider-octopus-like
            Grass Demon interacted with the small Finn inside the sword. The Grass Demon wrapped the sword Finn in goo,
            forming a cocoon around him. At an unknown period of time later, the interior of the sword was filled with
            green cobwebs and the cocoon appeared hardened. Both the Finn Sword and the Grass Demon expressed desire to
            get out. The Grass Demon instructed the Finn Sword to let it do the talking when they escape."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Fern emerged in "Reboot" when the Grass Sword touched the Finn Sword again and began to cover it until
            Finn's arm detached from his body. When Fern first emerged he looked like a lump of grass with a face but
            then began to resemble Finn in grass form, even gaining the ability to speak. He then revealed that he
            believed that he was Finn, considering the real Finn a threat and, later, an imitator/fan. When Jake
            confirmed the real Finn's identity, Fern became upset and ran from the duo."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Still believing himself to be Finn, Fern traveled to Finn and Jake's tree fort, greeting a confused BMO,
            who panicked and hid. After looking through a scrapbook of Finn and Jake's adventures, Fern became
            frustrated and confused and began to trash the fort. A frightened BMO called Finn and Jake and the two came
            straight home. Jake was furious with Fern for scaring BMO and wrecking their house, making Fern even more
            upset. Realizing the creature meant no harm, Finn offered him a Finn Cake. Finn Cakes are for "Finn only" so
            this made Fern felt more like himself. The group then went to bed and forgave one another for anything they
            may have done or said."
        </p>
        <p>
            "In "Do No Harm," Finn had to step out of Tree Fort to check on Susan, meaning Jake had to be alone with
            Fern much to his chagrin. Finn told Jake to pretend that Fern was him so and do "Finn stuff" with him. Jake
            made Fern meatloaf, which Fern tried to eat but learned his body was unable to consume food. This upset him
            since Fern still had memories of food and how it tasted. Fern was also unable to play the flute since he
            doesn't breathe. Jake then gave Fern the idea of going to an "evil dungeon to smash." Fern then took Jake to
            the Grassy Mountain where the Grassy Wizard lives. On their visit they fought grass monsters which made Fern
            happy, albeit a little more violent than Finn. At the top of the mountain they saw the Grassy Wizard, who
            recognized Fern. He then deduced that he came from the Grass Sword, leading Fern to realize that the wizard
            was his creator. Fern then proceeded to ask why he (as the grass-sword) existed, only to learn he only made
            the Grass Sword because it sounded cool and was a play on words, with no real dark plan behind him. When the
            Grassy Wizard asked Fern to kill Jake he then punched the Grassy Wizard as hard as he could, knocking him
            out."
        </p>
        <p>
            "At the end of the episode the Grassy Wizard was hospitalized and Fern was upset but Jake assured him that
            he did the right thing. Finn met with the two and told Fern he did a good job (Fern was not yet named so
            Finn called him "Grass me" while others mostly called him Grass Finn). Fern came to terms with his identity,
            so he coined a new name, Fern the Human. He then stole Starchy's motorcycle and took off."
        </p>
        <p>
            "In "The Invitation," it is revealed that Fern lives on top of the Tree Fort roof. Finn was about to leave
            for his journey to the islands so he wanted Fern to fill in for him while he was gone. Fern was flattered by
            this but Finn told him to kill monsters his way. It is also revealed that Fern crashed Starchy's motorcycle
            as well."
        </p>
        <p>
            "In "Whispers," Fern begins to become even more jealous of Finn due to his inabillity to do things the right
            way. He later thinks up a plan to become "The only Finn"."
        </p>
        <p>
            "In "Three Buckets," Fern finds out that he can make himself look like Finn. He traps Finn on the other side
            of a locked stone door and tells Finn that he was Finn for too long and that it was his turn. After Finn
            discovers that he can turn his metal arm into a rock breaking device, he breaks down the door and turns on
            weed-whacker mode. He tackles Fern and they fight until Finn accidentally cuts Fern to pieces."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Essentially, Fern is dead, but a mysterious man recovers his remains, puts it in a bucket and walks off.
            Fern's eyeball moves, implying that he can still be alive in a way."
        </p>
        <p>
            "In "Seventeen," a mysterious green knight crashes Finn's birthday party. In a match of arm-wrestling it is
            revealed that the green knight is Fern. Fern has been revived by the mystery man, who is revealed to be
            Princess Bubblegum's Uncle Gumbald. He is working for Gumbald along with Lolly and Chicle."
        </p>
        <p>
            "In the series finale "Come Along With Me," Finn and Jake, wanting to stop the Gum War, unleashed the
            nightmare juice given to them by Nightmare Princess, forcing themselves, Fern, Princess Bubblegum, and
            Gumbald into a hallucinatory slumber. In the dream, Fern transformed into a bird/pterodactyl-like creature
            and flew away, while Finn decided to follow him after turning into a butterfly. Finn tried to calm Fern
            down, and the two plummeted to the ground. Finn continued to try and appeal to Fern by reminding him that
            they were "two sides of the same coin" and that they share the same torment. However, Finn and Fern
            continued to fight, but were able to find common ground after Jake brought them to Finn's vault. Together
            they went in to confront the Grass Demon. Fern killed it, ridding himself of its influence once and for all.
            However, with no Grass Demon to control him, Fern began to deteriorate, as he can have no body without the
            Grass Demon."
        </p>
        <p>
            "After waking up, the Gum War was called off but GOLB descended, thrusting everyone into a new battle. Fern
            looked as he did before becoming the Green Knight but was beginning to disintegrate, but nevertheless wanted
            to fight with the others against GOLB. GOLB was later defeated, but Fern was still disintegrating, nearly
            dead. He told Finn his dying wish, to be planted at the Tree Fort (which unbeknownst to him, had been
            destroyed). Fern died, and what remained was a small seedling in the shape of the Finn Sword. That night,
            Finn and Jake planted the seedling together at what remained of their home. The seedling immediately
            blossomed into a new tree, with a new Finn Sword growing inside it."
        </p>
        <p>
            "In the far future, Shermy and Beth climbed the now massive tree that had sprouted from Fern's sapling, and
            pulled out the remade Finn Sword."
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Fern's Personality</strong>
        <p>
            "He originally communicated in gibberish-like words, an example being "Mwah!" but he soon learned how to
            articulate and hear normally."
        </p>
        <p>
            "As he was recently brought into existence, Fern initially thought of himself as the true Finn, before he
            began taking on his own personality as Fern. Fern doesn't understand much of what is considered right or
            wrong in a situation (such as when he suggested severing Sweet P's tendons to stop him from running), and is
            also considerably more aggressive and prone to violence than Finn, possibly due to the influence of the
            Grass Demon."
        </p>
        <p>
            "His memories are those of Finn's, so he goes through somewhat of an identity crisis after it's pointed out
            to him he's not Finn. Fern developed an inferiority complex of sorts after he failed to protect Ooo while
            Finn was away at sea. Afterward, in the presence of Finn, he feels like embracing his own personal identity
            leaves him overshadowed and as an inferior copy of Finn, which leads him to attempt a takeover of Finn's
            life."
        </p>
        <p>
            "It's worth mentioning, however, that even with this attempt, Fern does not actively seek to harm Finn,
            instead locking him in an underground tomb with the promise that he'll regularly return with food and
            water."
        </p>
        <p>
            "As the Green Knight, Fern lost his desire to be just like Finn, but now he sees himself as a better version
            of Finn. Despite this, he still thinks of Finn's memories as his own. He also developed a desire to kill
            Finn, but each time he attempts to do so either Aunt Lolly or Uncle Gumbald stops him before he gets a
            chance to cause any critical damage to him. Overall, he has become much more confident in his abilities."
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Fern's Abilities</strong>
        <p>
            "Being entirely composed of grass, he has the ability to change his appearance and shapeshift into any form
            he can think of in order to fight enemies. In "Do No Harm," he alters his hand into a grass sword to slice
            grass monsters in half with single swift strokes. He also changed them to huge thorny fist-like projections
            to beat up the Grassy Wizard. The main downside to these abilities is that being a body of grass, he can't
            eat like a human despite being able to taste, smell, and remember food."
        </p>
        <p>
            "In "Whispers" and "Three Buckets," it's revealed he has the ability to disguise himself as the real Finn,
            similar to how the Grass Sword disguised itself as a natural right arm; in addition, Fern is shown to be
            able to photosynthesize with light. In "Seventeen," Fern's new form as the Green Knight allows him to
            produce other plants, morph his arm into a blade, sprout multiple tentacles from his body and reveal his
            face depending on if he wants to or not. He can also form an axe from his tentacles which can turn into a
            snake controlled by him. The Green Knight can still choose to use the grass sword regardless of already
            having an axe and a blade shaped arm."

            <strong>In Conclusion: </strong>
            "Fern is one of my favorite characters! This is so true that I want to get some kind of tattoo for Fern! He
            is technically the original main character, he was screwed over and misunderstood. He just wanted to be
            himself but he wasn't anymore. He changed as do we all. Nobody treated him the same which took a toll on his
            mental health considering he didn't do anything to deserve this. He eventually finds his way but bites the
            dust shortly after in a heroic way. He died being the person he wanted to be, a hero! He deserved more love
            and appreciation in the show and by fans. I find him endeering and he is me coded. He is truly a lil guy as
            well!"
