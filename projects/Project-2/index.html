                <Strong>What is 3D Printing?</Strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                "3D printing is a fun hobby and useful to the future. It is a printer that melts plastic and places it
                mathematically to build something new from a digital model."

            <p>
                "3D printing has come a long way from where it started. It started out as printing small models like
                cubes
                and then even little toy boats. Now it is being used to print houses, prosthetics, candy, firearms,
                casts,
                and musical instruments. Anything you can imagine and make a 3d model of you can print!"

                <Strong>What Kind of Printer Should I Get?</Strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                "It is hard to know what printer you should get. After I got my first printer here is what I learned.
                First
                thing you should look for in a 3D printer is auto leveling. This will prevent many man made errors. If
                you
                are printing long or larger things a treadmill printer would be best for you. If not you can get
                non-treadmill 3D Printer."
