            <strong>Introduction: </strong>
            "Zote the Mighty is an NPC in Hollow Knight. He also has many titles for he is truly that magnificent! For
            being the character with the most dialogue in the game of Hollow Knight we
            do not have much information on Zote. He truly has earned the title of "Mysterious"!"

            <strong>Zote's Background/Lore</strong>
            "Zote is a traveller from outside Hallownest who came to the Kingdom to fulfill a promise. This is
            ultimately revealed to be a promise of glory for himself."
        <p>
            "He named his nail "Life Ender" because names supposedly have power. Unfortunately, because it is made of
            shellwood, it cannot deal damage."
        </p>
        <p>
            "While he claims to be the strongest warrior in the land, he is found trapped by weak enemies or claiming
            the glory of another bug's deeds. He regards the Knight as beneath him and accuses them of constantly
            getting in his way."
        </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>In Game Events</strong>
            "Found along the path leading to Greenpath. He is held in the mandibles of a Vengefly King, and the Knight
            has the choice to either save him or leave him. If saved, he complains that the Knight got in the way
            between him and his "prey", he introduces himself and boasts about his supposed mighty deeds."
        <p>
            "If he is not saved before acquiring the Mantis Claw, he dies in this location, with his nail and shell
            remaining. Hitting his shell here grants the Neglect achievement."
        </p>
        <p>
            "If he is saved in Greenpath, Zote shows up in Dirtmouth, where he once again talks to the Knight in an
            arrogant fashion."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Zote can be found in a corridor leading back to the storerooms of the City of Tears. He has forgotten the
            Knight and introduces himself again."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Found stuck in spider webs, presumably having been captured by the beasts of Deepnest. Once again the
            Knight has the choice to either save him or leave him, though this time leaving him does not result in his
            death. If saved, he once again complains about the Knight meddling in his supposed heroics."
        </p>
        <p>
            "If the Knight saves him both times, he is captured and can be found in the resting area of the Colosseum of
            Fools, where he brags about his skills and how his capture was part of his plan. He then becomes the final
            boss of the first trial. As a boss, he deals no damage due to his nail being made of shellwood. He simply
            has to be attacked until the fight is over. He is quite inept in combat and regularly messes up his jumps.
            Beating him grants the Rivalry achievement."
        </p>
        <p>
            "After the defeat, and after Bretta is rescued, he returns to Dirtmouth with the helmet of a Shielded Fool
            as a supposed "trophy" and claims that he is the new champion while slandering the Knight's reputation.[13]
            Bretta falls for him, her drawings and dolls of the Knight are replaced by a single portrait of Zote. Here
            he recites "The Fifty Seven Precepts Of Zote". In the basement of Bretta's house, the dream boss version of
            Zote, Hidden Dreams content Grey Prince Zote, can be fought."
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Godmaster Update</strong>
            "While Zote alone is too weak a creature to partake in the Godseeker's ritual, he is still present in other
            forms in the Hall of Gods. Hidden Dreams content Grey Prince Zote appears in the Pantheon of the Sage and
            the Hall of Gods. Additionally, in the Hall of Gods is found an endless gauntlet called The Eternal Ordeal
            which is an infinite number of dangerous Zotelings of various types."
        </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>In Conclusion: </strong>
            "Zote is one of my favorite characters! He truly believes that he is the strongest knight there is! He has
            all the confidence in the world! Zote also follows his own set of rules.
            But most importantly being a bug he is infact a lil guy!"
