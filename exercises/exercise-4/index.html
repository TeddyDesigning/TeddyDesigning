            <Strong>Introduction: </Strong>
            "Hello I bet you are wondering why this site has been made. Good question, moving on because thats not the
            point. You will now be able to learn who these fictional characters are
            and appreciate them becasue they deserve it!"
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>What is a fictional character?</strong>
            "A fictional character is a character who is fiction aka not real. However they should be in this case.
            These ones are just little gusy. How could you not like some little guys?
            Fictional characters are also art, they have to be illustrated somehow and also written in a way to make me
            love them and that's a fact. You will love them too by the end."
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Who are these fictional characters? Let me tell you their names and where they are from.</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <Strong>Fern</Strong>
                "Fern is a character from Adventure Time!"
            </li>
            <li>
                <Strong>Zote</Strong>
                "Zote is a character from Hollow Knight!"
            </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Why these characters?</strong>
            "These are characters that I have either felt some sort of connection with, related to, or just simply find
            them entertaining. Either way they have earned my respects. However they
            have not recieved the appreciation and respect they deserve from more people. This is to hopefully get you
            to like these characters. If you end up not liking them, then thats your
            wrong opinion; but an opinion none the less. I hope you will go check them out somehow online."
