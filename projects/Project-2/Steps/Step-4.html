                "Some people find ways to set up a camera watching their 3D printer so they can watch it from their
                phones. However this is not as easy for some. So you will want to periodically check in on your printer
                to make sure it is all printing smoothly. If the bed becomes unlevel then it could cause the filament to
                not lay down properly and you will just get 3D printed spaghetti everywhere which can potentially damage
                your printer. If this starts to happen turn off your printer and try to clean it while wearing some heat
                resistant gloves so you do not burn yourself. You will want to clean it before it cools because it will
                then become harder to clean once the plastic cools and hardens. You may also want to make
                micro-adjustments if you have a manual leveling printing bed when it starts to print to make sure the
                plastic is laying evenly across the bed and is the proper distance away."
