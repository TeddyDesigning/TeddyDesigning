                "Once your print is done you will want to carefully pull it off of the printing bed. Sometimes a metal
                scrapping tool is helpful for removing it off of the printing bed. You will then want to remove any
                supports that were printed also. Any rough edges you will want to sand. Some people to get a smoother
                print will soak a paper towel in acetone and place it in a plastic bin with a lid for a couple minutes
                to an hour. Be careful as this will start to dissolve the material. If you printed your model in pieces
                you can assemble it with plastic bonder or super glue. Let sit for as long as directed to avoid any
                breaking apart. After that you can paint or just enjoy your new 3D print!"
