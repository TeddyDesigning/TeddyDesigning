                "To find a model there are multiple ways to go about this. You will want to either get a program like
                blender and make your own models which is more advanced. Or you can go to websites and look for models.
                You can find free models on www.thingverse.com. You can also go to www.cults3D.com which has many more
                models however some of these models are required to be purchased. After going to one of these sites and
                downloading a model load it into your 3D printing software or get UltiMaker Cura online for free. This
                is a common free slicer that is very effective. After loading your model make sure it fits into your
                printer size. Then choose the percent of fill. More fill means more durable. More fill also uses more
                filament. Once you choose your fill set up supports if the model needs. Then slice your model and upload
                it to your sd card. Put it into your printer and print after setting up."
